# Lighter Airbrake JS

A smaller more lightweight version of Airbrake's Browser js library.

This has been reduced by using targeting ES2019 and avoiding polyfills. 

This is NOT designed to run inside of node

## Installation



```sh
npm install airbrake-js-lite
```

See the airbrake docs for how to use this library. This library is NOT published via unpkg or any other
script hosting provider. You are expected to add this as a part of your js build process.
